# APDL-routines-for-optimization

This codes were developed as a requirement for my Graduation Project in mechanical engineering. They were based in the article 
"An efficient 3D topology optimization code written in MATLAB" by K. Liu & A. Tovar 2014. It uses the SIMP method by Martin P. Bends√∏e, 1989.
The SIMP method was applied uppon Ansys finite element framework and the /PREP7 environment was used to model the piece according to the optimization results.
